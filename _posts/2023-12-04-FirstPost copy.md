The first skit I saw was the skit where the people were sorted by pool noodle length. The rapper was really funny along with his beatboxing friend.

The next skit was the Al Capone vs Apes. This one was also very funny, especially the guy who was making monkey screeching noises randomly. It gave a good example of how quick sort vs random sorting works.

After this was the dating show. I didn't find this one too funny, but it was good to understand how bubble sorting worked.

Lastly was the army of flowers, and how they used merge sort. I agreed with the judges when they said that there was no explanation on what happens after the pairs of two are made, but it was still really fun to learn!

Overall, I really enjoyed Algorhythmic 2024!
